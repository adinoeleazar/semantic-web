                    I was staring at the door, making it out in my mind rather than seeing it, in the dark. I lay quite 
                    still — a victim already — the arrhythmia of my heart was fleeing, knocking this way and that 
                    against its body-cage. How finely tuned the senses are, just out of rest, sleep! I could never listen 
                    intently as that in the distractions of the day, I was reading every faintest sound, identifying and 
                    classifying its possible threat. 
                    
                    But I learned that I was to be neither threatened nor spared. There was no human weight 
                    pressing on the boards, the creaking was a buckling, an epicenter of stress. I was in it. The house 
                    that surrounds me while I sleep is built on undermined ground; far beneath my bed, the floor, the 
                    house's foundations, the stopes and passages of gold mines have hollowed the rock, and when some 
                    face trembles, detaches and falls, three thousand feet below, the whole house shifts slightly, 
                    bringing uneasy strain to the balance and counterbalance of brick, cement, wood and glass that hold it 
                    as a structure around me. The misbeats of my heart tailed off like the last muffled flourishes on one 
                    of the wooden xylophones made by the Chopi and T songa 1 migrant miners who might have been 
                    down there, under me in the earth at that moment. The stope where the fall was could have been 
                    disused, dripping water from its ruptured veins; or men might now be interred there in the most 
                    profound of tombs.

                    I couldn't find a position in which my mind would let go of my body — release me to sleep 
                    again. So I began to tell myself a story, a bedtime story.
                    In a house, in a suburb, in a city, there were a man and his wife who loved each other very much 
                    and were living happily ever after. They had a little boy, and they loved him very much. They had 
                    a cat and a dog that the little boy loved very much. They had a car and a caravan trailer for 
                    holidays, and a swimming-pool which was fenced so that the little boy and his playmates would 
                    not fall in and drown. They had a housemaid who was absolutely trustworthy and an itinerant 
                    gardener who was highly recommended by the neighbors. For when they began to live happily ever 
                    after they were warned, by that wise old witch, the husband's mother, not to take on anyone off the 
                    street. They were inscribed in a medical benefit society, their pet dog was licensed, they were 
                    insured against fire, flood damage and theft, and subscribed to the local Neighborhood Watch, 
                    which supplied them with a plaque for their gates lettered Y OU HAVE BEEN WARNED 
                    over the silhouette of a would-be intruder. He was masked; it could not be said if he was 
                    black or white, and therefore proved the property owner was no racist.
